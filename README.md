# zm_robot

The zm robot is a autonomous mobile robot by 4 mecanum wheel driving under Gazebo simulation. It has two 2D-Didar, RGB-D camera and Imu sensor. The purpose of this project is to make it easy for people to understand the control method of Omnidirectional Wheel and the establishment of mobile robots in the environment of ROS and Gazebo.

## Built with

- ROS Foxy under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

------

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Installation ros package.

    ``` $ sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-foxy-gazebo-ros ros-foxy-gazebo-dev ```

    ``` $ sudo apt-get install -y libgazebo11-dev ```
    
    ``` $ sudo apt-get install -y gazebo11 ```

    ``` $ sudo apt-get install -y ros-foxy-cartographer-ros ```
  
    ``` $ sudo apt-get install -y ros-foxy-navigation2 ```
    
    ``` $ sudo apt-get install -y ros-foxy-nav2-bringup ```
    
  - You may need to source Gazebo's setup file if you're having difficulty finding plugins and other resources. 
  
    ``` $ source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh ```

- clone gazebo_mecanum_plugins package.

``` bash
$ git clone -b ros2-foxy https://github.com/qaz9517532846/gazebo_mecanum_plugins.git
```

- clone AWS RoboMaker Small Warehouse World package.

``` bash
$ git clone -b ros2 https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world
```

### Run

- The zm_robot 3d model xaro file into Rviz.

``` bash
$ ros2 launch zm_robot_description zm_robot_demo.launch.py
```

- The zm_robot 3d model xaro file into Gazebo.

``` bash
$ ros2 launch zm_robot_gazebo zm_robot_empty_world.launch.py
```

- This is a zm_robot control using a keyboard.

``` bash
$ ros2 run zm_robot_teleop zm_robot_teleope_key
```

- The zm_robot warehouse environment under Gazebo.

``` bash
$ ros2 launch zm_robot_gazebo zm_robot_aws_warehouse.launch.py
```

- The zm_robot create a map at warehouse.

``` bash
$ ros2 launch zm_robot_navigation zm_robot_cartographer.launch.py
```

- Cartographer save map command.

``` bash
$ ros2 service call /finish_trajectory cartographer_ros_msgs/srv/FinishTrajectory "{trajectory_id : 0}"
$ ros2 service call /write_state cartographer_ros_msgs/srv/WriteState "{filename : '${HOME}/zm_robot_cartographer_map.pbstream'}"
$ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
```

- The zm_robot can do navigation and aviod obstacles at warehouse.

``` bash
$ ros2 launch zm_robot_navigation zm_robot_navigation2.launch.py
```
